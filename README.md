## Installation

Add lita-cryptocrat to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

## Contributing

Actual bot code is in the `lita-cryptocrat` directory.  Feel free to add features, clean up code, etc.  Just open a pull-request to master with a description of the changes.

At some point I'll set up CI and tests, but for now, just please test locally.  Be sure to comment/uncomment out the config slack/shell in `lita_config.rb`.

Docs for Lita development can be found here: https://docs.lita.io/plugin-authoring/handlers/

Any questions, just ping me in the channel.
